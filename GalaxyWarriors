Project Description:
Our game will be similar to a game created in the 80s called Galaga (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvjapcHsqXY).
The game involves a player controlled rocket ship that defends against waves of enemies that come flying across the screen. The 
goal is to eliminate every alien ship to advance to the next level. These aliens will sometimes have unpredictable patterns. There will also
be random objects (space debris) that will try and take out the player. Depending on how much time we have for this project, we may also
implement powerups, bonus rounds, final bosses, etc
To summarize, The user will need to avoid space debris, 
and also shoot and eliminate all the aliens.

Plan: We are not 100% sure on the exact plan yet, but we plan on at least setting up the environment in Unity (folders, organization, etc)
After this is done we will implement some of the movement patterns (x and y axis), and maybe even start designing the spacecrafts and aliens.
We will then slowly work on the collisions, and enemy movements
